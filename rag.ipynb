    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is an AI technique that combines retrieval of relevant information with generative models to produce more context-aware and accurate responses. Unlike traditional generative AI models that rely solely on the knowledge encoded during training, RAG leverages external knowledge sources, such as databases, document stores, or knowledge bases, to provide up-to-date information, improving the quality and relevance of responses. Leveraging structured or semi-structured **knowledge bases** can help create a more targeted RAG solution. In our example we have been using Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a RAG workflow, the generative model interacts with a retriever that fetches relevant documents or data based on a user's query. These retrieved items are then used as context to generate a final response. This approach allows the generative AI to generate answers that are both informed by the latest knowledge and tailored to the user's question."

    "## Why RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is useful for a wide range of scenarios because it combines the benefits of generative language models with the ability to reference up-to-date, external information. Here are some key reasons why RAG is beneficial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enhanced Accuracy**: Improves the factual accuracy of the generated responses, making it ideal for dynamic industries or domains where the knowledge base is constantly changing. For instance, in legal or medical fields, where new information is regularly updated, RAG ensures that generated responses reflect the most current and reliable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Personalization**: Retrieval can be tailored to individual users, allowing the AI to generate more personalized content by retrieving documents relevant to a user's history or preferences. In customer service, for example, RAG can be used to retrieve past interactions and provide customized responses that improve user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Domain Specificity**: Leverage domain-specific knowledge bases, providing detailed, accurate answers that are particularly useful for specialized fields like medicine, law, and finance. By accessing curated knowledge bases or internal documentation, the generative model can provide domain-specific responses that would not be possible with a general model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reduced Hallucination**: Generative models sometimes \"hallucinate\" and produce incorrect facts. RAG mitigates this by grounding generation in real, retrieved content, reducing the likelihood of incorrect or misleading information. This grounding mechanism is critical in high-stakes scenarios where misinformation can lead to significant consequences.\n"

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "## When to Use RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is particularly useful in the following situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Knowledge Requirements**: When the knowledge required to answer a question is constantly changing or being updated, such as in news, legal, or medical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Complex Queries**: When answering complex or multi-faceted queries that require synthesizing information from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Highly Specialized Domains**: When the domain of the question is highly specialized, such as industry-specific customer support, technical documentation, or research, where relying solely on a pre-trained model may not suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Customer Service**: When personalization and context are required to provide accurate, user-specific responses in customer support or chatbots."

    "## When Not to Use RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "While RAG is a powerful approach, it isn't always the best fit for every problem. Some situations where RAG might not be useful include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purely Creative Content**: If the task is focused purely on creative storytelling or generating novel content without strict factual requirements, a traditional generative model without retrieval might be more suitable. For instance, writing a fictional story or creating poetry can benefit from the model's inherent creativity without the need for external references.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simple Queries**: For straightforward queries that require factual answers readily available in the language model's pre-trained dataset, adding retrieval can add unnecessary complexity. For example, questions like \"What is the capital of France?\" can be directly answered by a pre-trained model without the need for a retrieval step.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Real-Time Interaction**: RAG can add latency due to the retrieval process. If the application requires near-instantaneous responses, such as in chatbots where response time is crucial to user satisfaction, RAG may introduce delays that impact the user experience."

They would win their eighth World Series title the next day, coming back from a 5–0 deficit, a record for most runs to come from behind in a World Series clinching game.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\nThis series marked the twelfth World Series meeting between the Dodgers and Yankees and the first since 1981. It was also the thirteenth meeting between teams from New York City and Los Angeles for a major professional sports championship. This previously happened in four World Series (1963, 1977, 1978, 1981), three NBA Finals (1970, 1972, and 1973) and the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals. Following the 2024 World Series, LA teams held a five to four advantage over New York City teams in terms of championship matchups between the two cities.\\nAdditionally, this World Series was contested between the two eventual winners of the most valuable player (MVP) awards in their respective leagues: Aaron Judge of the Yankees and Shohei Ohtani of the Dodgers. This was the first World Series since 2012 (when Buster Posey of the San Francisco Giants faced Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers) to feature the two league MVPs from that season. Judge won the American League (AL) MVP Award in 2022, while Ohtani won two AL MVP awards unanimously with the Los Angeles Angels in 2021 and 2023. During the 2024 regular season, Judge hit 58 home runs while Ohtani hit 54 during his 50–50 season, meaning that this is the first time in Major League Baseball history that two batters who hit 50 home runs in the same regular season are playing against each other in the World Series. Because of the renewal of the rivalry between the two storied franchises, and the World Series debuts of both Ohtani and Judge, many regarded the matchup as a \"dream\" World Series in the lead-up to the event.\\nThe Dodgers won a three-game series against the Yankees in June in New York, winning the first two games before dropping the finale, though Juan Soto did not appear in the series.\\nThis was the first World Series to feature the teams with the best record in each league since the 2020 World Series. This was just the fifth time in the Wild Card era (1995–present) where both teams with the best record in each league faced each other in the World Series.\\n\\n\\n=== Los Angeles Dodgers ===\\n\\nAfter back-to-back upset losses to division rivals in the postseason in 2022 and 2023, the Dodgers looked to reshape their roster.

The franchise follows Sonic, an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who battles the evil Doctor Eggman, a mad scientist. The main Sonic the Hedgehog games are platformers mostly developed by Sonic Team; other games, developed by various studios, include spin-offs in the racing, fighting, party and sports genres. The franchise also incorporates printed media, animations, feature films, and merchandise.\\nNaka, Ohshima, and Yasuhara developed the first Sonic game, released in 1991 for the Sega Genesis, to provide Sega with a mascot to compete with Nintendo\\'s Mario. Its success helped Sega become one of the leading video game companies during the fourth generation of video game consoles in the early 1990s. Sega Technical Institute developed the next three Sonic games, plus the spin-off Sonic Spinball (1993). A number of Sonic games were also developed for Sega\\'s 8-bit consoles, the Master System and Game Gear. After a hiatus during the unsuccessful Saturn era, the first major 3D Sonic game, Sonic Adventure, was released in 1998 for the Dreamcast. Sega exited the console market and shifted to third-party development in 2001, continuing the series on Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation systems. Takashi Iizuka has been the series\\' producer since 2010.\\nSonic\\'s recurring elements include a ring-based health system, level locales such as Green Hill Zone, and fast-paced gameplay. The games typically feature Sonic setting out to stop Eggman\\'s schemes for world domination, and the player navigates levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops. Later games added a large cast of characters; some, such as Miles \"Tails\" Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, and Shadow the Hedgehog, have starred in spin-offs. The franchise has crossed over with other video game franchises in games such as Mario & Sonic, Sega All-Stars, and Super Smash Bros. Outside of video games, Sonic includes comic books published by Archie Comics, Fleetway Publications, and IDW Publishing; animated series produced by DIC Entertainment, TMS Entertainment, Genao Productions, and Netflix; a live-action film series produced by Paramount Pictures; and toys, including Lego construction sets.\\nSonic the Hedgehog is Sega\\'s flagship franchise and one of the bestselling video game franchises, selling over 140 million copies by 2016 and grossing over $5 billion as of 2014. Series sales and free-to-play mobile game downloads totaled 1.77 billion as of 2024. The Genesis Sonic games have been described as representative of the culture of the 1990s and listed among the greatest of all time. Although later games, such as the 2006 game, received poorer reviews, Sonic is influential in the video game industry and is frequently referenced in popular culture.

First played in 1903, the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball\\'s National League (NL) and American League (AL). Often referred to as the \"Fall Classic\", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players\\' strike. The best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff. Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner\\'s Trophy. Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past. The winning team is traditionally invited to the White House to meet the President of the United States.\\nA total of 120 World Series have been contested through 2024, with the AL champion winning 68 and the NL champion winning 52. The New York Yankees of the AL have played in 41 World Series, winning 27 – the most championship appearances and most victories by any MLB team. The Dodgers and the Yankees are tied for the most losses with 14 each. The St. Louis Cardinals have won 11 championships, the most among NL clubs and second-most all-time behind the Yankees. The Dodgers have represented the NL the most in the World Series with 22 appearances. The Seattle Mariners are the only MLB franchise that has never appeared in a World Series; the Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, Tampa Bay Rays, and Colorado Rockies have all played in the Series but have never won it, with the Padres and the Rays appearing twice. The Los Angeles Angels and Washington Nationals are the only teams who have won their only World Series appearance, and the Toronto Blue Jays and Miami Marlins are the only teams with multiple World Series appearances with no losses. The Toronto Blue Jays are the only franchise from outside the United States to appear in and win a World Series, winning in 1992 and 1993. The Houston Astros are the only franchise to have represented both the NL (2005) and the AL (2017, 2019, 2021, 2022), winning the Series in 2017 and 2022.  The 1919 and 2017 World Series were both marred with cheating scandals: the Black Sox Scandal and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal. The most recent World Series champions are the Los Angeles Dodgers.\\nThe last team to repeat as champions were the Yankees in 2000. Two World Series matchups (in 1982 and 2005) have no possibility of a rematch due to one of the contending teams switching to the opposing league – the Milwaukee Brewers moved to the NL in 1998, and the Houston Astros moved to the AL in 2013.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Series_champions'}' in Redis\n"
